This article shows you how to create simple git server and explain how to use git command.
for example, git clone, add, commit, push. 
most important thins is to understand the git's concept and basic terminology, if not, it's not easy to soak into git world.

** Git Concept
*** Basic Terminology
[[./git-term.png]]

  | working tree    | the set of working files for the repository. these files are changed and committed to repository.                        |
  | stage(or index) | the place to store changes in the working tree before the commit.                                                        |
  | repository      | origin: normally indicate remote repository                                                                              |
  | branch          | a named pointer to a commit, *master* is default.                                                                           |
  |                 | master: normall your own branch                                                                                          |
  |                 | check out: selecting a branch                                                                                            |

*** Git Operation
[[./git-operations.png]]

** Setting up private git repository
Sometimes you should create your own git repository, but github, specially in closed network environment.
So the first section is to make your own git repository.
  - ref: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-Setting-Up-the-Server

*** demo environment
To make you understand easily, I assume below demo environment.
  ** demo environment **
  - git server: vm1
  - git client computer: vm2
  - developer1: John on vm2
  - developer2: Jane on vm2

*** git user on git server
At first, we will create git user to allow other user's connection.
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Original guide lets user create ssh-key, but I'll just use password type on ssh connection.
It is better to use ssh-key, but I want to keep focus on the git based command.  
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_SRC 
## on git server
vm1$ sudo adduser git
vm1$ sudo passwd git
vm1$ su git
#+END_SRC shell

*** make git repository on git server
Let's create *project* directory and initialize it.
 
#+BEGIN_SRC shell 
## on git server
vm1$ mkdir ~git/test_project.git
vm1$ cd ~git/test_project.git
vm1$ git init --bare
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/git/test_project.git/ ## <-- remember this path, copy it. 
#+END_SRC shell

*** Create John's project named 'test_project'
John will create the 1st project.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell 
## as John user on vm2
john@vm2$ mkdir myproject
john@vm2$ cd myproject
john@vm2$ git init
john@vm2$ echo "the first released project" > README.md
john@vm2$ git add .
john@vm2$ git commit -m 'the 1st'
john@vm2$ git remote add origin git@vm1:/home/git/test_project.git ## <-- paste it from above
john@vm2$ git push origin master
#+END_SRC shell

You will get some _password_ message for ssh-key after ** git push origin master ** command.
Then, press *ENTER* and you will be asked 'ssh password', at this time, input *git's password*.
*** Clone 'test_project' for Jane 

Jane will modify the file and push to master.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell 
## as Jane user on vm2
jane@vm2$ git clone git@vm1:/home/git/test_project.git
jane@vm2$ cd test_project
jane@vm2$ echo "jane's code is add here" >> README.md
jane@vm2$ git add README.md
jane@vm2$ git commit -m 'new code added by jane'
jane@vm2$ git push origin master
#+END_SRC shell

*** Online Git Practice 
just follow the below sandbox, this is better than I can explain

** Git Workflow

#+BEGIN_SRC shell 

#+END_SRC shell
** Conclution
Git is very useful to manage your contents not only source codes but also your own documents. 
Also in this devops erra, knowing the git workflow makes you communicate with other organization easily.
I hope this document to be helpful.
